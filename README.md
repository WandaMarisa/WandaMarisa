<p>ðŸ’¡ Interests:
 <p> I'm captivated by the intricate web of energy systems, from renewable sources to innovative technologies that can revolutionize our power generation and consumption. Exploring the mysteries of our planet's geological history is a passion of mine, and I'm always eager to learn more. Besides my core interests, I'm always open to new knowledge and challenges. Whether it's coding, data analysis, or any other exciting field, I'm eager to learn and grow.
